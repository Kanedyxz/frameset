<p style="color:white;font-size:25px;font-family:verdana;" align="center" color="white" font size="10" >Zenitsu is cowardly, weak-willed, and anxious, often claiming that he doesn't have long to live due<BR><BR>to the dangerous job of being a Demon Slayer. He has rather low self-esteem despite his talent and<BR><BR>strength, even considering himself useless, evident when he couldn't believe he had slain a demon<BR><BR>and tricked himself into instead believing that it was Shoichi, even though the latter was a young<BR><BR>child who didn't possess any form of skill. Zenitsu is in a constant state of fear and he frequently<BR><BR>tries to run away at the sight of danger, claiming he wants to live a modest, normal life, instead of<BR><BR>that of a Demon Slayer. Due to this, Zenitsu screams and shouts a lot, much to the annoyance of the people around him.</p>
