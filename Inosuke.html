<p style="color:white;font-size:25px;font-family:verdana;" align="center" color="white" font size="10" >Inosuke is short-tempered, confrontational, abrasive and proud. He always likes to think he is the<BR><BR>strongest fighter in a situation, constantly challenging most people he comes across and wanting<BR><BR>others to respect and praise him for his skill. This often leads him into unnecessary danger, since<BR><BR>he tends to overestimate his abilities in comparison to who he's fighting and refuses to accept when<BR><BR>he's been defeated, which can be seen when Giyu Tomioka has to tie him up after his fight with<BR><BR>the Father to prevent him challenging the Hashira to a fight while still severely injured from his<BR><BR>previous battle. This constant wanting to be the best can also cause Inosuke to be very<BR><BR>provocative, as he often tries to goad others, most prominently Tanjiro Kamado, into fighting him,<BR><BR>although in the case of the latter he usually fails due to Tanjiro's obliviously kind nature.</p>
